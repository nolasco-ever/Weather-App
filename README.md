# Weather-App
This weather app was created in React JS using the Open Weather Map API. This app allows the user to search for a specific city in the United States and display the 7-day forecast. While the user types into the search box, location suggestions pop up in the suggestions box and are updated instantaneously as the user changes their search query. The suggestions also contain the location's current temperature and an icon representing the cloud conditions (cloudy, rainy, clear, snowy, etc.) which is fetched from the API.<br>
 <br>
 Once the user submits their search query, a 7-day forecast fades in and is displayed containing the day, temperature, cloud conditions, weather description, and high and low temperatures for the current day. This too is done by fetching the information using the API.<br>
 <br>
 All in all, the skills required for this project are HTML, CSS, Javascript with the React library (including useState and useSpring (for animations)) and the use of APIs.
